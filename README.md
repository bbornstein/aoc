# Advent of Code

If you like puzzles and programming, you might enjoy [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com).  It’s an “advent calendar of small
programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that
can be solved in any programming language you like,” [1, 2] using
spreadsheets, or even FPGAs [3].  The self-contained nature of each
puzzle with well-defined requirements, inputs, and outputs is a
refreshing break from the fuzzy, real-world technical problems we’re
often called upon to solve in our everyday work.  I’ve found small
puzzles like this to be a great forcing function to learn a new
programming language.

If you decide to participate, Lan Dang has created a JPL Slack channel:
